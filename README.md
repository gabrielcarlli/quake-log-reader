# Quake 3 log parser

This is the project I made for the Jr. Software Engineer opening

<summary><h3><b>Project Info</b></h3></summary>

This is a simple Ruby on Rails based webpage that can read quake 3 logs or use the one provided in the test ([here](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/704a555a0fe475ae0284ad9088e203f1))

The "USE DEMO" button will use the the aforementioned log. You can upload other ones whenever you please through the homepage

Fortunately, pretty easy to run!

- If you do not have ruby installed, please install the 2.7.5 version of Ruby using Rbenv.
- If you do not have rails installed, please install it through the terminal command ```gem install rails```

After cloning and running a bundle install, you can just start it through ```rails s``` and access it through your local host (http://localhost:3000/). No other configuration is necessary.
